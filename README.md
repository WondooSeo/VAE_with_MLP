# VAE with MLP

Language : Python 3 & Keras

This code is self-made version of https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10112 . [^1]

Stage 1 : Training VAE with EIT data

Stage 2 : Training MLP with voltage - latent vector of VAE pairs

Stage 3 : Call encoder of VAE and MLP, and show the result

This structure works well, but need modification of path or else.

# Need more modification!

This codes are seperated with 3 files follow 3 stages in paper. Have to integrate in one file.
